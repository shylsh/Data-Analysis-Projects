HR Analytics Project
Project Overview
This project is designed to analyze HR data to provide valuable insights into employee attrition, performance, and other key metrics. The main tools used in this project include SQL for data extraction and manipulation, and Power BI for data visualization. This repository contains the following key files:

hrdata_project.sql: This SQL file contains the scripts for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes. It includes various queries to analyze HR data and derive meaningful insights.
HR_Dashboard.pbix: This Power BI file includes the interactive dashboard created for visualizing the HR data, providing a comprehensive view of various HR metrics.
Files Description
hrdata_project.sql: This file includes SQL scripts that are essential for data analysis. The scripts perform operations such as:

Extracting data from HR databases.
Transforming raw data into structured formats.
Calculating key HR metrics like attrition rate, average tenure, and employee performance scores.
Aggregating and summarizing data to support visualizations.
HR_Dashboard.pbix: This is a Power BI file that contains the HR dashboard. The dashboard visualizes the data processed by the SQL scripts and includes various charts, graphs, and interactive elements to explore the following:

Attrition Analysis: Visual representation of attrition rates across different departments and job roles.
Performance Metrics: Insights into employee performance scores, highlighting top performers.
Demographic Breakdown: Analysis of employee demographics such as age, gender, and tenure.
Key Features
Attrition Analysis: Understand the patterns and reasons behind employee attrition, helping HR teams to devise strategies to reduce turnover.
Performance Monitoring: Track and monitor employee performance, identifying high performers and areas needing improvement.
Interactive Visualizations: The Power BI dashboard provides an intuitive interface for exploring HR data, with interactive filters and drill-down capabilities.
